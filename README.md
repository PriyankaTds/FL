# Text Classification using Federated Learning and Differential Privacy

This project implements text classification using **Federated Learning** while preserving user privacy through **Differential Privacy (DP)** techniques. The model is trained across multiple decentralized clients without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy and security.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- **Federated Learning (FL)**: Decentralized training across multiple clients.
- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: Protects sensitive data by adding controlled noise.
- **Secure Aggregation**: Ensures private updates without exposing individual client data.
- **Text Classification**: Trains models to categorize textual data into predefined classes.
