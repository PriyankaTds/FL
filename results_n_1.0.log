2025-03-25 05:45:05,669 - DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.server.start_server() is deprecated.
	Instead, use the `flower-superlink` CLI command to start a SuperLink as shown below:

		$ flower-superlink --insecure

	To view usage and all available options, run:

		$ flower-superlink --help

	Using `start_server()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
